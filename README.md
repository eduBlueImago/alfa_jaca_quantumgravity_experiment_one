Alpha (Α or α; Greek: άλφα, transl.: álpha) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet[1] and has a numerical value of 1. It is derived from the Phoenician letter Aleph or Álef.[2][3] Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin A and the Cyrillic letter A.

Plutarch in Moralia presents a discussion of why the letter alpha is first in the alphabet. Plutarch's speaker suggests that Cadmus, the Phoenician who supposedly lived in the Greek city of Thebes and introduced the alphabet to Greece, "put alpha first because that is the Phoenician name for the bull, which they, like Hesiod, considered not the second or third, but the first of necessities." This is a reference to a passage in Hesiod's Works and Days that advised early Greek farmers to "First get a bull, then a woman." A simpler explanation is that it was the first letter in the Phoenician alphabet.

According to Plutarch's natural order of assigning vowels to the planets, alpha was linked to the Moon. They were also associated with the Moon in the early religious symbolism of both the Sumerians and Egyptians due to the crescent shape of their horns.

The capital letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it is usually written identically to the Latin letter A.

In physics, the lowercase letter α is used as a symbol for, among others, angular acceleration, the linear coefficient of thermal expansion, and proportionality.
